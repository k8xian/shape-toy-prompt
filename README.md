#Write Up Requirements

Write an overview of your implementation (no more than one page)

Write high level overview of the decisions you made in your code.

Document concepts you learned that future programmers reading your code would likely benefit from knowing.

Describe how you think this implementation would or wouldn't be able to respond to future feature requests (It's okay if the answer is it won't but please explore why you think that is true).

Write out any expected performance bottlenecks you see with this approach, and at a high level, how you think those should be addressed.

Write out a short plan for what you would need to change / add to your program to support the following features

localStorage based persistence

undo/redo

save to image - already implemented
